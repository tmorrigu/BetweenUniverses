# BetweenUniverses
Beginner Unity3D Game

<h1>Hello! </h1>
<h2> If you are reading this, then you're probably in the wrong place.</h2>

<p>My work on Between Universes is open source, and will remain open source throughout development and 
distribution (shooting for the stars here!)</p>
<p>However, this is my first major project in Unity 3D, as well as my first major project in C#. Feedback is 
welcome, but I am unlikely to accept any pull requests at this time, as this is a learning project. If I 
reach a point where I feel comfortable moving from learning to polishing on this project, I will remove this message 
and all contributions will be both welcomed and credited!</p>

<h3>Happy Coding!</p>
